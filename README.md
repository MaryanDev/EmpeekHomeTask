# EmpeekHomeTask
Test home task from Empeek
This software is aimed to browse directories and files on the compter where it is hosted. Also it can calculate count of small, 
medium and large files in current folder and subfolders. Of course if directory contains a lot of files that process can take a lot of time,
so sometimes it is not interactive.
Developed using ASP.NET Web Api + AngularJs.
